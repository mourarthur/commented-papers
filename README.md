# Commented Papers

My comments and notes on papers I've been reading.  
Direct quotes will generally be in *itallics*. Sometimes I will include direct translations alongside my own comments. I did not go to great lenghts to separate one from the other, but I am obviously not claiming autorship over anything that is not my original production.

**Remember to always cite the original papers.** Science is built on accountability.
